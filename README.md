#  🐻 Animated Bear Login App with Flutter  🐻

This project demonstrates a login interface where an animated bear interacts dynamically with the user, creating a playful and engaging experience.  

## 🔹 Interactive Behavior
- 👁️ **Email Input:** The bear’s eyes follow your typing  
- 🙊 **Password Input:** The bear hides its face  
- 😟 **Invalid Password:** The bear reacts with a sad expression  
- 🎊 **Valid Password:** The bear celebrates the successful login  

## 🎨 About Rive Animations
Rive is a platform for creating lightweight, real-time, and interactive vector animations. Unlike GIFs or videos, Rive animations can respond to user input and app states, allowing developers to craft dynamic UI experiences.  

### ⚙️ State Machine Concept
In Rive, a State Machine manages how animations respond to events and variables. It allows:
- Conditional transitions between animation states  
- Responses triggered by user actions  
- Fine control over character expressions and movements  

## 🛠️ Tools and Technologies used
- **Visual Studio Code** – Code editor and development environment  
- **Flutter** – UI development framework  
- **Dart** – Programming language for app logic  
- **Rive** – Interactive animation integration  
- **State Machine** – Animation logic control  

## 📁 Project Structure
The project is organized mainly in the `lib/` folder:

- `main.dart` – Launches the app and sets the home screen  
- `login_screen.dart` – Implements the login UI and manages the bear animation  

Other important folder:  
- `assets/` – Stores the `.riv` animation file
